# [Markdown-editor](https://yasamanloghmani.github.io/markdown-editor/)
This is my first Mintbean Hackathon project, our objetive was to build a markdown editor in 4 hours. I used HTML, CSS, JS, JQuery and Showdown to build a cute, responsive editor that will convert and reset.

User can choose a project background color, font color and font family.
